# Spotify Clone
The purpose of this project is to recreate Spotify's complete functionality using the Nextjs framework. I also plan on adding some custom features, but at the time of writing I still do not clearly know what I would like to add. 

## Technologies used

* NEXTJS
* NEXT-AUTH
* REACT
* TS
* JWT
* Spotify Web API JS

## Next-auth
Wrapping the the app in SessionProvider keeps the app in sync with the server. 
The "useSession" hook is used to check whether a user is authetnticated.
